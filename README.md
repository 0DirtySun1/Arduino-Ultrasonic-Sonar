Based on "Ultrasonic Radar" from NimishaChitriv

To run the program on an Arduino Microcontroler (i used Arduino Uno)
you need to download ArduinoIDE and Processing IDE for the graphics.

The .ino File is for ArduinoIDE and the .pde File is for Processing.

Before its ready to use you have to open the Arduino File in the IDE
and click on "Select Board" in the top left corner to get the right
Port (for me it was "COM 5")

Next you upload the Program to your Arduino and open Processing.
There you change the Port on the 19th Line and change the resolution
to your Liking.

Last but not least you start the Processing and your ready to scan
for Fiends ;)
